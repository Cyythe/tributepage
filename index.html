      <h5>The Life of the Original "People's Champ":</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>1942</b> - Born as Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr. in Louisville, Kentucky.</p>
          <li>
            <p><b>1954</b> - Police officer and boxing coach <em>Joe E. Martin</em> introduces Clay to boxing after encountering him fuming over his stolen bicycle. Clay told the officer he was going to "whup" the thief. Martin told him he better learn to
              box first. After some time, Cassius Clay made his boxing debut against <em>Ronnie O'Keefe</em>, winning by split decision.</p>
            <li>
              <p><b>1960</b> - Won the Light Heavyweight gold medal in the Summer Olympics in Rome. Made his professional boxing debut against <em>Tunney Hunsaker</em>, winning a six-round decision.</p>
              <li>
                <p><b>1960-1963</b> - Achieved a record of 19 - 0 with 15 wins by knockout.</p>
                <li>
                  <p><b>1964</b> - Cassius Clay, age 22, defeated <em>Sonny Liston</em> by TKO in round seven, becoming, at that time, the youngest boxer to take the title from a reigning heavyweight champion. Soon after the fight, Clay changed his name
                    to
                    <em>Cassius
                    X Clay</em>, and then later to <em>Muhammad Ali</em> after converting to Islam.</p>
                  <li>
                    <p><b>1965</b> - Ali faced Liston in Lewiston, Maine in a contraversial rematch in which Liston was knocked down by a difficult-to-see blow the press dubbed a "phantom punch". Ali would go on to be declared the winner by knockout after
                      the fight was stopped in under two minutes. Speculation over whether Liston "took a dive" and , if so, why, is still a matter of debate. On November 22nd, Ali defended his title in a successful 12 round match against former heavyweight
                      champ <em>Floyd Patterson</em> that resulted in a TKO. </p>
<li>
  <p><b>1966</b> - Ali agreed to fight then WBA heavyweight champion <em>Ernie Terrell</em> in Chicago on March 29. In February Ali was reclassified by the Louisville draft board as "1-A" ( Available for military service) from "1-Y (
                        Registrant qualified for service only in time of war or national emergency), and he stated that he would refuse to serve. The Illinios Athletic Commission refused to sanction the fight, citing technicalities, leading Ali to travel
                        to Canada and Europe to compete. He returned to the U.S. to fight <em>Cleveland Williams</em> on November 14th in the Houston Astrodome, winning a third-round TKO.</p>
                      <li>
                        <p><b>1967</b> -The Ali vs. Terrell match took place in Houston on February 6th. During the lead up to the bout, Terrell repeatly called ALi "Clay", much to Ali's annoyance due to his religous beliefs. Ali won a unanimous 15-round
                          decision, but faced accusations of cruelty for his apparent intent to prolong the fight to punish Terrell. After Ali's title defense against <em>Zora Folley</em> on March 22nd, he was stripped of his title and had his boxing
                          license suspended by the state of New York due to his refusal to be drafted in the Army. On June 20th, he was convicted of draft evasion and sentenced to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Ali paid bond and remained free
                          during the appeals process.

                            was still in appeal. In September 1970, a victory in federal court forced New York State Boxing Commission to reinstate Ali's license. He fought <em>Jerry Quarry</em> on October 26th resulting in a win after three rounds. In
                            December 1970, he fought <em>Oscar Bonavena</em> at Madison Square Garden resulting in a dramatic win by TKO in the 15th round.</p>
